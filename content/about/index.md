I am a software engineer who manages physics simulations 
for a multinational original equipment manufacturer. 
In a previous life, I was a research mathematician 
studying [algebraic geometry](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/about-us/departmental-art/theory/algebraic-geometry) 
and [geometric representation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Langlands_correspondence).
I live [just north](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=The+Woodlands,+TX) 
of Houston, TXn.

My interests include: 
* Functional programming, especially with
   [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) derivatives such as 
   [F#](https://fsharp.org/). 
   Check out the 
   [Houston functional programming users group](https://hfpug.org/)! 
* Renewable Energy, particularly [geothermal energy](https://energy.sandia.gov/programs/renewable-energy/geothermal-research/).
* [Jazz music](https://www.aacmchicago.org/).
* Speculative fiction.

NB: The cattle dog pictured above is Gisele, a former foster! 
My dog Humphrey is pictured below with parrot.

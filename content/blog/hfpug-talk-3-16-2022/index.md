I gave a talk at the [Houston Functional Programming Users Group](https://hfpug.org)
titled "Types and Categories the Easy Way". I had hoped to give a really, truly
high-level presentation on how one can use Category theory to understand software design
patterns. I'm not sure I accomplished that goal, but I think this talk is a good start.

Here is an outline:
* *Dramatis Personae*: Key Terms
* *Act 1*: Categories
* *Act 2*: Functors
* *Act 3*: Monads + examples
